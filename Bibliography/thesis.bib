	abstract = {Historically, trade unions have embodied a social force leading to greater democratization of the workplace, helping to ensure a balance of power in the employment relationship. Trade union presence and the rate of collective bargaining coverage have thus been associated with a reduction in income inequality, an increase in the minimum wage and greater industrial democracy (Freeman \& Medoff, 1984; Freeman 2005; OECD, 2011). This wage-levelling effect appears to be stronger where union density is higher (Aidt \& Tzannatos 2002; Koeniger et al. 2007, Tzannatos, 2008) and where collective bargaining is centralized (OECD 2004; Aidt and Tzannatos 2002). On the other hand, studies have shown that a decline in union membership in several countries has contributed to a rise in income inequality (OCDE 2011; Jaumotte \& Osorio Buitron, 2015). A recent paper by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a volume edited by Berg (2015), clearly showed that a reduction in inequality is contingent on a strengthening of labor market institutions, notably collective bargaining and various labor laws, and institutions that allow for income redistribution. Another study have shown that a reduction in bargaining coverage contributes significantly to rising wage inequality (Bosch 2015) and to bargaining outcomes that allow for higher wage flexibility (Antonczyk et al. 2010).},

            Trade union institutions are historically and comparatively weak in the United States, and union membership has been in steady decline over several decades. Scholars thus question the contemporary relevance of organized labor to social policy. Yet, there is considerable state-level variation in social policy and union institutional strength that remains underexamined. Focusing on variability across US states, this paper uses mixed-methods analysis to examine relationships between organized labor and parental and family leave legislation under varying political conditions. Event history analysis of state-level leave policy adoption from 1983 to 2016 shows that union institutional strength, particularly in the public sector, is positively associated with the timing of leave policy adoption. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other factors, including Democratic control of state houses, which is also shown to facilitate leave policy adoption. Comparative case studies support event history findings and illustrate how state house partisanship informs the level of government that leave advocates target for policy change. The paper concludes by suggesting further attention to subnational policies and investigation into the social movement practice of target-shifting and its effects. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the operation of power resources at the subnational level within a liberal market national context.},

After discussing the different concepts and measuring problems of subjective job insecurity, a model is presented highlighting the main variables and channels of transmissions affecting the perception of job insecurity. The impact of the different theoretical dimensions affecting the perception of job insecurity is estimated using a logistic regression. The analysis shows that the differences in subjective job insecurity of women are fully explained by their objective situation in the labour market. In contrast, insecurity grows with age; education contributes negatively to job insecurity, as do wages, except at very high wage levels; having a temporary contract contributes to insecurity, but not so having a part time job, which points to the different nature of two types of contracts very commonly analysed in tandem.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the effect of changing union density on earnings differentials and inequality among male workers in the U.S. and on industry earnings differentials among OECD countries. For the U.S. the evidence indicates that the fall in union density contributed to the 1980s increase in earnings inequality. Cross section-based estimates of union wage effects suggest that 40-50\% of the rise in the white collar premium. 15-40\% of the rise in the college premium. and 20\% of the rise in the standard deviation of In earnings for all men are attributable to the fall in union density. Longitudinal-based estimates of union wage effects suggest that deunionization contributed less to the rise in differentials. Still. the dispersion of earnings grew as much among organized workers as among otherwise comparable nonunion workers, so that overall dispersion would have risen substantially even if the entire work force had been organized. Deunionization was thus a factor in the rise in inequality but not the factor. The cross-country comparisons show that earnings distributions are more compact among union workers than among nonunion workers in OECD countries with different union densities, types of union movements, and with very different union/nonunion wage differentials, making the relation between unionism and dispersion a general outcome of unionism. not something specific to U.S. institutions. In addition, they indicate that earnings differentials by industry are smaller and increased less in the 1980s in highly unionized countries than in less unionized countries, suggesting that strong national union movements can partially offset market pressures for rising inequality.},

I then test the key argument that unions' power centrality has significant positive effects on governance, controlling for general socioeconomic and international factors. The findings from standard statistical analyses, as well as from comparative case studies of affiliation networks, support my claims that union-centered or union-linked civic mobilization achieves a balance of class power not only in civil society, but also within state institutions, strengthening reformist parties and policy makers. This article also suggests that this power shift in the state power structure leads to better governance. I highlight the role of labor-based organizations in making governments effective and responsible, and I bring the bottom-up process of civic mobilization and social accountability back into the discussion of social capital and governance.},

With a lack of representation by labor unions, workers are less secure in their jobs, which could cause a reduction in job satisfaction and an increase in stress. Therefore, a declining union density can also influence the subjective well-being of an impacted group. The aim of this research was to identify and investigate the potential relationships between union density and wage inequality and union density and subjective well-being across thirteen countries through regression analysis. The thirteen countries selected were all developed, industrialized democracies and members of the OECD. Simple linear regressions were made using the most recent national data for union density, wealth inequality, and subjective well-being. Regression analysis was performed on the most recent data points of the countries as a group, and for each country individually over a period of time. There was a moderate-strong, negative correlation (R = - 0.608) for the regression of wealth inequality versus union density, yet inconsistent correlation coefficients between countries individually. There was a moderate-weak, positive correlation (R = 0.353) for the regression of subjective well-being versus union density, with more consistent correlation coefficients between countries individually.},

	abstract = {Two causal mechanisms have been invoked to explain the positive correlation between union membership and social expenditure. Unions try to influence policy, but they are also more successful in mobilizing members in economic systems in which actors engage in co-ordinated strategic interaction. Applying insights from the policy feedback and comparative capitalism literatures, our analysis indicates that union density is a determinant of social expenditure. A strong policy feedback effect is also present whereby social expenditure has a positive effect on union density. We find a positive effect of union density on social expenditure in co-ordinated market economies, but not in liberal market economies. We discuss the implications of these findings for citizens’ capacity to influence policy in varied contexts and for the ‘varieties of capitalism’ literature, and we close with some speculation about the implications of these findings in the current economic downturn.},

The econometric model is estimated separately for five skill groups using a large panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with lower levels of observed skills. In addition, the patterns of selection bias differ by skill group. Among workers with lower levels of observed skill, unionized workers are positively selected, whereas union workers are negatively selected from among those with higher levels of observed skill.},

Unionization rates of men fell between the two sample periods, with bigger declines among lower skill groups. These trends account for 15–20\% of the rise in male wage inequality. Union membership rates of low-wage women also declined, while unionization increased among higher-wage women. On balance, shifting unionization accounts for very little of the rise in female wage inequality. Economy-wide trends in unionization mask a sharp divergence between the private sector, where unionism was declining, and the public sector, where it was rising. Comparisons across sectors suggest that unionization substantially slowed the growth in wage inequality in the public sector.},

Economic internationalisation makes it easier for employers to escape national structures of employment regulation, and appears to weaken the ability of governments to defend nationally-based social models; sectoral and occupational shifts in employment erode traditional union strongholds, while social and ideological changes undermine workers' traditional orientation to collectivism. Yet what do we mean by trade union strategy, and how can it be modernised?
