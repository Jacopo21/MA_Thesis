	abstract = {Objective/Context: This article follows some of the debates around the creation of the minimum wage mandate in Mexico during the 1930s. I focus on how different actors used science to justify their demands, especially the need to use physiological and nutritional information to know the population's requirements. As a result, the heterogeneous way to fix the wages at the local (municipal) level changed with the proclamation of a federal mandate in the 1930s, using the most recent cost of living surveys, which included the nutritional requirements for the workers. Methodology: Following the methods used by the history of science, this article gives a panoramic view of the problems that existed before the federal minimum wage mandate and concerning the use of science as a legitimizing tool of the post-revolutionary state. Originality: This article makes a brief historical reconstruction of the minimum wage in the 1930s, and its federalization, which is absent from historiography, and proposes to articulate the history of science and its influence on economic and social accounts. Conclusions: This article shows how political and social projects--like the definition of a minimum wage--depended on science to obtain authority and, in turn, how these social projects provided inputs for the construction of specialized scientific lines of research.

	abstract = {Individual patterns of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in wakefulness and sleep are among the most heritable traits in humans, yet distinct genetic and neurochemical mechanisms underlying EEG phenotypes are largely unknown. A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme playing an important role in cortical dopamine metabolism, causes a common substitution of methionine (Met) for valine (Val) at codon 158 of COMT protein. Val allele homozygotes exhibit higher COMT activity and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal cortex than Met/Met homozygotes. Evidence suggests that this polymorphism affects executive functions in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that it also modulates functional aspects of EEG in wakefulness and sleep. EEG recordings were conducted twice on separate occasions in 10 Val/Val and 12 Met/Met allele carriers (all men) in wakefulness, and in baseline and recovery sleep before and after 40 h prolonged waking. During sleep deprivation, subjects received placebo and modafinil in randomized, cross-over manner. We show that the Val158Met polymorphism predicts stable and frequency-specific, interindividual variation in brain alpha oscillations. Alpha peak frequency in wakefulness was 1.4 Hz slower in Val/Val genotype than in Met/Met genotype. Moreover, Val/Val allele carriers exhibited less 11-13 Hz activity than Met/Met homozygotes in wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep. This difference was resistant against the effects of sleep deprivation and modafinil. The data demonstrate that mechanisms involving COMT contribute to interindividual differences in brain alpha oscillations, which are functionally related to executive performance such as counting tendency on a random number generation task in young adults.},

	abstract = {The debt to GDP ratio of Italy remains at 130\% of GDP, the second highest in the euro area. Moreover, under current policy settings it is poised even to increase, rather than fall, over the next few years. This outlook has led the European Commission to start a debt-driven excessive deficit procedure against the country. The key issue is not so much the deficit, which has remained below 3\% of GDP so far, but the fact that public debt is not falling. Whether or not this procedure will go beyond its early stages is not clear. But it is certain that in the end, all the European authorities could do is to impose a fine of a few decimals of a percent of GDP.
The real arbiter of Italian public finances thus remains the financial markets where the Italian Treasury has to sell its debt to finance both the current deficit and the roll-over of past debt coming due.
In this context, the holdings structure of government debt becomes important. Knowing who are the ultimate holders of Italian public debt is crucial for answering two important questions:
1. What is the proportion of ‘patient’ holders, and those likely to trade frequently?
2. Who would carry the losses should there be a default?},

We argue that KfW successfully managed to navigate these challenges in order to retain, and even increase, its ability to conduct selective industrial policy in the post-1980s era. This was possible because of Germany's hard currency and low sovereign credit risk, large market size, which was augmented by membership in the European Union, and Germany's position as regional hegemon within Europe. More broadly, this shows how, conditional on domestic politics, advanced economies are able to shape and exploit the rules of the international economic system to implement industrial policies to their advantage, even as developing countries are given the opposite policy recommendations.},

Also, how did the financial crisis and the emergence of other countries' export credit provision programs impact the international discourse surrounding export finance?

	abstract = {The potential impact of automation on the labour market is a topic that has generated significant interest and concern amongst scholars, policymakers and the broader public. A number of studies have estimated occupation-specific risk profiles by examining how suitable associated skills and tasks are for automation. However, little work has sought to take a more holistic view on the process of labour reallocation and how employment prospects are impacted as displaced workers transition into new jobs. In this article, we develop a data-driven model to analyse how workers move through an empirically derived occupational mobility network in response to automation scenarios. At a macro level, our model reproduces the Beveridge curve, a key stylized fact in the labour market. At a micro level, our model provides occupation-specific estimates of changes in short and long-term unemployment corresponding to specific automation shocks. We find that the network structure plays an important role in determining unemployment levels, with occupations in particular areas of the network having few job transition opportunities. In an automation scenario where low wage occupations are more likely to be automated than high wage occupations, the network effects are also more likely to increase the long-term unemployment of low-wage occupations.},

	abstract = {Historically, trade unions have embodied a social force leading to greater democratization of the workplace, helping to ensure a balance of power in the employment relationship. Trade union presence and the rate of collective bargaining coverage have thus been associated with a reduction in income inequality, an increase in the minimum wage and greater industrial democracy (Freeman \& Medoff, 1984; Freeman 2005; OECD, 2011). This wage-levelling effect appears to be stronger where union density is higher (Aidt \& Tzannatos 2002; Koeniger et al. 2007, Tzannatos, 2008) and where collective bargaining is centralized (OECD 2004; Aidt and Tzannatos 2002). On the other hand, studies have shown that a decline in union membership in several countries has contributed to a rise in income inequality (OCDE 2011; Jaumotte \& Osorio Buitron, 2015). A recent paper by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a volume edited by Berg (2015), clearly showed that a reduction in inequality is contingent on a strengthening of labor market institutions, notably collective bargaining and various labor laws, and institutions that allow for income redistribution. Another study have shown that a reduction in bargaining coverage contributes significantly to rising wage inequality (Bosch 2015) and to bargaining outcomes that allow for higher wage flexibility (Antonczyk et al. 2010).},

            Trade union institutions are historically and comparatively weak in the United States, and union membership has been in steady decline over several decades. Scholars thus question the contemporary relevance of organized labor to social policy. Yet, there is considerable state-level variation in social policy and union institutional strength that remains underexamined. Focusing on variability across US states, this paper uses mixed-methods analysis to examine relationships between organized labor and parental and family leave legislation under varying political conditions. Event history analysis of state-level leave policy adoption from 1983 to 2016 shows that union institutional strength, particularly in the public sector, is positively associated with the timing of leave policy adoption. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other factors, including Democratic control of state houses, which is also shown to facilitate leave policy adoption. Comparative case studies support event history findings and illustrate how state house partisanship informs the level of government that leave advocates target for policy change. The paper concludes by suggesting further attention to subnational policies and investigation into the social movement practice of target-shifting and its effects. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the operation of power resources at the subnational level within a liberal market national context.},

Transaction costs are then made endogenous, and it is shown how the underlying structure of payments limits, without necessarily completely determining, the choice and role of a vehicle currency.

	abstract = {Oil is an important energy resource. Fluctuation in international crude oil prices affects all aspects of the economy. The exchange rate is one of the important channels for the international crude oil price shock to pass to the real economy and financial markets. The impact of international crude oil price fluctuation on the exchange rate of oil-importing countries has attracted more and more attention. The US dollar is the main invoice and settlement currency of the international oil market. The change of the US dollar exchange rate will inevitably affect the international crude oil price. By combing the relevant classic literature and recent literature, the relationship between international crude oil prices and the exchange rate of oil-importing countries is discussed. Due to the different methods of use, the relationship between the two is not conclusive. This paper probes into the impact paths of national crude oil price fluctuation on the exchange rate of oil-importing countries, but the influence level depends on the relative degree of each country affected by oil prices, which cannot be generalized. The article summarizes the methods of studying the relationship between oil prices and exchange rates, most of which are studying the causal relationship between the two and their mutual influence, nonlinear structure, and volatility spillover effects. Through reviewing and summarizing the relevant literatures, this paper argues that exploring the inherent laws of oil price volatility buffer under different exchange rate regimes and studying the transmission mode and intensity of oil price fluctuations on exchange rate effects can be the focus of future research.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, fundamental factors of supply and demand were important in understanding oil price dynamics before the financial crisis. These factors, however, are no longer sufficient to explain the price behavior of the oil market in the post-financial crisis era since 2008. The financialization of oil futures markets has been responsible for changes in price behavior and co-movement between oil prices and financial asset prices, among others. The globalization of the world economy has further strengthened the interactions between oil markets and financial markets, which allows oil prices to exhibit more financial characteristics. This paper reviews current literature pertaining to financial factors affecting oil price change and the influence of oil prices on stock market returns and volatility. We conclude that the drivers of oil price change vary across different periods but the fundamentals remain the underlying causes affecting the long-term trend of oil prices. These financial factors are the important driving force for the extremely volatile oil price dynamics since the twenty-first century. When studying oil-stock interactions, it is important to consider a combined framework including the decomposition of oil price shocks, the asymmetry and time-varying effects of interaction, the impacts of structural changes and macroeconomic variables on the transmission of information, and risks in the oil-stock nexus. Finally, future research directions relating factors affecting oil price and the oil-stock nexus are highlighted. Specifically, the application of behavioral finance theory helps to explain the mechanism of oil price dynamics from a microperspective. The effect of changes in energy consumption structure and climate policies should be taken into account in understanding oil price change. Using of implied volatility index in the oil market and the stock market may provide new insight into the oil-stock nexus.},

Numerous studies have addressed the effect of price volatility on specific economic parameters. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review of the interactions between global macroeconomic performance and oil price volatility (OPV). Price volatility is intrinsic in commodity markets, but has been advancing at a faster rate in the crude oil market in comparison to other commodities over the past decade, reflecting the status of oil as the most globalised commodity. In this paper, the analytical literature review and analysis of the behavioral responses of macroeconomic agents to OPV shows that such volatility has several damaging and destabilizing macroeconomic impacts that will present a fundamental barrier to future sustainable economic growth if left unchecked. To ensure macroeconomic isolation from OPV, a combination of supply and demand-side policies have been recommended that can help to mitigate and build resilience to the economic uncertainty advanced by OPV.},

	abstract = {Oil and natural gas are closely related to people's daily needs and the production of various industries. In recent years, oil and gas price volatility has brought renewed attention to the oil and gas industry. This paper sets out to study how external shocks and internal risks affect the stability of oil and gas supply networks and thus the global energy supply. The structure and fragility of the oil and gas supply network and the impact of the fragility of the supply network on the Russian Federation's oil and gas supply are described through a literature review. Finally, it is found that the composition and scale of the supply network, the harsh mining environment, the unstable financial market, the technical difficulties, the safety of practitioners, and other factors all have a significant negative impact on the global energy supply.},

After discussing the different concepts and measuring problems of subjective job insecurity, a model is presented highlighting the main variables and channels of transmissions affecting the perception of job insecurity. The impact of the different theoretical dimensions affecting the perception of job insecurity is estimated using a logistic regression. The analysis shows that the differences in subjective job insecurity of women are fully explained by their objective situation in the labour market. In contrast, insecurity grows with age; education contributes negatively to job insecurity, as do wages, except at very high wage levels; having a temporary contract contributes to insecurity, but not so having a part time job, which points to the different nature of two types of contracts very commonly analysed in tandem.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the effect of changing union density on earnings differentials and inequality among male workers in the U.S. and on industry earnings differentials among OECD countries. For the U.S. the evidence indicates that the fall in union density contributed to the 1980s increase in earnings inequality. Cross section-based estimates of union wage effects suggest that 40-50\% of the rise in the white collar premium. 15-40\% of the rise in the college premium. and 20\% of the rise in the standard deviation of In earnings for all men are attributable to the fall in union density. Longitudinal-based estimates of union wage effects suggest that deunionization contributed less to the rise in differentials. Still. the dispersion of earnings grew as much among organized workers as among otherwise comparable nonunion workers, so that overall dispersion would have risen substantially even if the entire work force had been organized. Deunionization was thus a factor in the rise in inequality but not the factor. The cross-country comparisons show that earnings distributions are more compact among union workers than among nonunion workers in OECD countries with different union densities, types of union movements, and with very different union/nonunion wage differentials, making the relation between unionism and dispersion a general outcome of unionism. not something specific to U.S. institutions. In addition, they indicate that earnings differentials by industry are smaller and increased less in the 1980s in highly unionized countries than in less unionized countries, suggesting that strong national union movements can partially offset market pressures for rising inequality.},

I first construct three measures to capture the connectedness and power of representative voluntary civic associations, membership density, degree centrality (comemberships), and power centrality, based on the affiliation network matrices for 54 countries, using the latest World Values Survey. I then test the key argument that unions' power centrality has significant positive effects on governance, controlling for general socioeconomic and international factors. The findings from standard statistical analyses, as well as from comparative case studies of affiliation networks, support my claims that union-centered or union-linked civic mobilization achieves a balance of class power not only in civil society, but also within state institutions, strengthening reformist parties and policy makers. This article also suggests that this power shift in the state power structure leads to better governance. I highlight the role of labor-based organizations in making governments effective and responsible, and I bring the bottom-up process of civic mobilization and social accountability back into the discussion of social capital and governance.},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s, the labor union density has gradually declined across member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), indicating a lowering percentage of employees represented by unions. In the United States, the declining union density has been shown to have an impact on wealth inequality, which has increased correspondingly. With a lack of representation by labor unions, workers are less secure in their jobs, which could cause a reduction in job satisfaction and an increase in stress. Therefore, a declining union density can also influence the subjective well-being of an impacted group. The aim of this research was to identify and investigate the potential relationships between union density and wage inequality and union density and subjective well-being across thirteen countries through regression analysis. The thirteen countries selected were all developed, industrialized democracies and members of the OECD. Simple linear regressions were made using the most recent national data for union density, wealth inequality, and subjective well-being. Regression analysis was performed on the most recent data points of the countries as a group, and for each country individually over a period of time. There was a moderate-strong, negative correlation (R = - 0.608) for the regression of wealth inequality versus union density, yet inconsistent correlation coefficients between countries individually. There was a moderate-weak, positive correlation (R = 0.353) for the regression of subjective well-being versus union density, with more consistent correlation coefficients between countries individually.},

	abstract = {Two causal mechanisms have been invoked to explain the positive correlation between union membership and social expenditure. Unions try to influence policy, but they are also more successful in mobilizing members in economic systems in which actors engage in co-ordinated strategic interaction. Applying insights from the policy feedback and comparative capitalism literatures, our analysis indicates that union density is a determinant of social expenditure. A strong policy feedback effect is also present whereby social expenditure has a positive effect on union density. We find a positive effect of union density on social expenditure in co-ordinated market economies, but not in liberal market economies. We discuss the implications of these findings for citizens’ capacity to influence policy in varied contexts and for the ‘varieties of capitalism’ literature, and we close with some speculation about the implications of these findings in the current economic downturn.},

The econometric model is estimated separately for five skill groups using a large panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with lower levels of observed skills. In addition, the patterns of selection bias differ by skill group. Among workers with lower levels of observed skill, unionized workers are positively selected, whereas union workers are negatively selected from among those with higher levels of observed skill.},

Unionization rates of men fell between the two sample periods, with bigger declines among lower skill groups. These trends account for 15–20\% of the rise in male wage inequality. Union membership rates of low-wage women also declined, while unionization increased among higher-wage women. On balance, shifting unionization accounts for very little of the rise in female wage inequality. Economy-wide trends in unionization mask a sharp divergence between the private sector, where unionism was declining, and the public sector, where it was rising. Comparisons across sectors suggest that unionization substantially slowed the growth in wage inequality in the public sector.},

Economic internationalisation makes it easier for employers to escape national structures of employment regulation, and appears to weaken the ability of governments to defend nationally-based social models; sectoral and occupational shifts in employment erode traditional union strongholds, while social and ideological changes undermine workers' traditional orientation to collectivism. Yet what do we mean by trade union strategy, and how can it be modernised?
