## 1. Research Question:
The following project aims to analyse the impact of Trade Unions Coverage on Income Inequality, over the past 20 years in EU countries. For this research, the selected countries are Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
With this in mind, the particular focus must be placed on two fundamental research variables: the Coverage and the Density of labour unions. Collective Bargaining Coverage, according to ILO, explains the number of workers whose pay and/or conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective agreement(s). On the other side, Trade Union Density is the ratio of wage and salary earners that are trade union members to the total number of wage and salary earners in the economy. According to the Eurofund, net trade union density rates take into account only those union members that are employed; it therefore excludes union members who are retired, unemployed or student members.
Beginning in the early 1980s, trade union membership across many EU Member States has seen a downward trend, primarily because an increasing number of workers are opting out of joining trade unions. A significant factor behind this drop in membership numbers is the rise of non-standard employment types. Unlike union membership rates, changes in trade union density rates are generally more consistent, reflecting broader labour market trends. For example, during the recent economic downturn, the decrease in union density decelerated as a result of a significant reduction in employment levels.

Research in economics indicates that collective bargaining significantly contributes to the equalization of earnings. Studies commonly show that increased rates of collective bargaining coverage are associated with decreased income disparity. Moreover, nations with more centralized bargaining processes usually experience a smaller wage disparity between the lower and upper ends of the wage spectrum. This correlation is evidenced by wage distribution metrics, like the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of earnings. Typically, countries with extensive collective bargaining coverage, especially those that engage in multi-employer negotiations at the inter-professional or sectoral level, demonstrate reduced earnings inequality according to this measure.


# 2. Variables used
## Gini Index
### Direct Measure of Inequality: 
The Gini Index is a widely used measure of income inequality within a country. A higher Gini coefficient suggests greater income disparity. It's a central variable for any analysis concerning inequality.
### Interactions with Labor Metrics: 
Correlations with trade union density and collective bargaining coverage may indicate the influence of labour unions on income distribution.
## Collective Bargaining Coverage
### Extent of Union Influence: 
Represents the percentage of workers covered by collective wage agreements, reflecting the influence of trade unions in the labour market.
### Correlation with Inequality: 
Any significant correlation with the Gini Index suggests that collective bargaining may play a role in moderating income inequality.
## Trade Union Density
### Union Membership Proportion: 
The percentage of workers who are union members. It is key to understanding the power and reach of labour unions within the labour market.
### Impact on Wages and Inequality: 
A correlation with wage growth and the Gini Index would indicate the effectiveness of unions in advocating for higher wages and possibly reducing income inequality.
## Wage Growth
### Indicator of Economic Progress: 
Represents the rate at which wages are rising in the economy, signifying economic health and worker prosperity.
### Influence on Inequality: 
Strong wage growth, especially if correlated with union metrics, can suggest that unions are successful in negotiating higher pay, potentially reducing inequality.
## Inflation
### Cost of Living Adjustment: 
Inflation impacts the real purchasing power of wages. High inflation can erode wage gains, while low inflation can make even modest wage increases more valuable.
### Connection to Wage Growth: 
The correlation between inflation and wage growth could suggest whether wage increases are keeping up with the cost of living, impacting real income and inequality.
## Labor Force
### Workforce Size: 
The proportion of the population that is working or actively seeking work. It's a fundamental indicator of the health of the labor market.
### Link to Unemployment and Part-time Employment: 
Correlations here could indicate trends in job availability and job quality, affecting income distribution and union strategies.
## Female Workers & Women Unemployment Rate
### Gender Dynamics in Labor: 
These variables reflect the participation and unemployment rates of women in the workforce, crucial for understanding gender-specific labor issues.
### Inequality Implications: 
High unemployment for women or a large proportion of female workers in low-wage or part-time jobs could exacerbate gender-based income disparities.
## Tax Contribution
### Fiscal Pressure on Workers: 
The level of tax contribution can indicate the financial burden on workers and can reflect the progressiveness of the tax system.
### Relationship with Inequality: 
A strong tax system that is progressive can help in reducing income inequality by redistributing income.
## Part-time Employment
### Job Quality Indicator: 
A high level of part-time employment may reflect underemployment or a lack of full-time opportunities, potentially leading to higher income inequality.
### Union Strategies: 
Unions may focus on converting part-time positions to full-time to ensure better wages and job security.
## Exports Growth, FDI Inflow/Outflow, Imports Growth
### Economic Openness and Performance: 
These reflect the country's integration into the global economy and can influence job creation, wages, and thus income inequality.
### Union Influence: 
Strong unions might advocate for trade and investment policies that protect domestic jobs and promote fair labor standards internationally.
## Children out of School, Primary
### Educational Access Indicator: 
Reflects the inclusiveness and reach of the education system. Education is key to higher lifetime earnings and lower inequality.
### Long-term Inequality Impact: 
Lack of education access can perpetuate inequality, highlighting a potential area for union advocacy in terms of social policy.


## 2.1 Based on these variables, let's categorize them for the causal map:

- Collective Bargaining Variables: Collective Bargain Coverage, Trade Unions Density.
- Income Inequality Variables: Gini Index.
- Economic Variables: Real Average Annual Wage Growth, Annual Inflation CPI, Exports of Goods and services (annual % growth), Foreign direct investment (net inflows and outflows as % of GDP), Imports of goods and services (% of GDP).
- Labor Market Variables: Employment/population ratio, Labour force participation rate, Unemployment rate, Labor force total, Labor tax and contributions (% of commercial profits), Part time employment, total (% of total employment).
